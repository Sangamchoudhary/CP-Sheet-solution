Pro tips

1. DP
- Whenever you stuck thinking you need 2 states for DP, try to make valid jumps from one 
  index to another to convert it in 1 state DP -----> refer ques 15 dp easy section
- Sometime you don't need to follow strict constraints, remove extra constraints with some 
  condition ------> refer 2nd question DP medium
